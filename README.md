# Primitive-football
 A football with primitive character as players.
 My first project in unity. I have learned a number of functionalities while doing this project, for example, UI, buttons, various functions and scripts for movement, ending game, adding a timer, counting, etc.
It is meant to be played in a VR headset with the help of a wii balance board as an input. The input is taken using the Wii balance walker v5.0
